    <h1>Inteneting is easy</h1>
    <p>First we need to learn some basic Html</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>

    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are 6 levels of heading.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note ow the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <p>Other times, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><strong><em>And sometime you need to shout!</em></strong></p>
